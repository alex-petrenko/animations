Title:

We present DexPBT: Scaling up Dexterous Manipulation for Hand-Arm Systems with Population Based Training

Intro:

In this work, we introduce a new family of continuous control tasks focused on dexterous object manipulation.
We target a robotic system consisting of an multi-fingered Allegro hand mounted on a Kuka arm with a total of 23 degrees of freedom.

We apply Reinforcement Learning and Population-Based Training to find effective control policies in five different scenarios.

Scenarios:

First scenario is a single-arm regrasping.
Here the task is to grasp the object and hold it in a specified location for one second.
After each successful grasp, the object is moved to a new random position.
